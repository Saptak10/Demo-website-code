<h1>Fitness</h1>
<p>Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,[1] moderate-vigorous physical exercise,[2] and sufficient rest.</p>
<h3>High intensity interval training(HIIT)</h3>
<p>High-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed at a high level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low-intensity activity.[26] Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity has increased cardiac benefits for humans, compared to when exercising at a low or moderate level.</p>
<h3>Mental health</h3>
<p>Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental health and well-being.[46][47] This improvement is due to an increase in blood flow to the brain allowing for the release of hormones as well as a decrease stress hormones in the body like cortisol and adrenaline while also stimulating the human bodyâ€™s mood boosters and natural painkillers.</p>
