<h1>About</h1>
<h3>Webpage</h3>
A web page (or webpage) is a specific collection of content provided by a website and displayed to a user in a web browser. A website typically consists of many web pages linked together in a coherent fashion. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book
<h3>Elements</h3>
The core element of a web page is one or more text files written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[1] Many web pages also make use of JavaScript code for dynamic behavior and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) code for presentation semantics.[1] Images, videos, and other multimedia files are also often embedded in web pages.
<h3>Navigation</h3>
Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their browser, that page's elements are downloaded from web servers. The browser then transforms all of the elements into an interactive visual representation on the user's device.
  <h3>Deployment</h3>
From the perspective of server-side website deployment, there are two types of web pages: static and dynamic. Static pages are retrieved from the web server's file system without any modification,[3] while dynamic pages must be created by the server on the fly, typically drawing from a database to fill out a web template, before being sent to the user's browser.
